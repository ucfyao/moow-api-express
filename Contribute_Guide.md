# Steps to Contribute Code to a GitHub Open Source Project
# This is the updated version.
1. **Fork the Project**:
   - Find the project on GitHub, click the "Fork" button at the top right to copy the project to your own repository.
   - After forking, you can find the project under your account.

2. **Clone the Repository Locally**:
   - In your repository, find the forked project and clone it to your local computer.

3. **Create a Branch**:
   - Open the cloned project on your local computer and create a new branch for your code changes.
   - Use the following command to create a branch: 
     ```sh
     git checkout -b your_new_branch
     ```
   - Replace `your_new_branch` with your branch name following the branch naming conventions.

4. **Write Code**:
   - Make your code changes locally and test them. Visual Studio Code is recommended as the editor.

5. **Commit and Push Code**:
   - Pull the latest code to avoid conflicts:
     ```sh
     git pull
     ```
   - Commit your changes and push them to your branch in your repository:
     ```sh
     git add <file>
     git commit -m "your_commit_message"
     git push origin your_new_branch
     ```
   - Replace `your_commit_message` with a meaningful commit message. Ensure there is only one commit per pull request.

6. **Create a Pull Request**:
   - In your repository, switch to the branch you created and click "New pull request" to submit your changes to the original project. Add comments and descriptions to explain your changes.

7. **Wait for Review**:
   - The original author will review your pull request. If changes are needed, modify your code locally and push the changes to the same pull request. Once accepted, your code will be merged into the project.

### Important Notes:
- Follow the project's contribution guidelines and development processes to ensure code quality and project stability.
- Respect the work of the original author and other contributors, and avoid unnecessary disruptions and impacts on the project.
